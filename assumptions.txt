assume: 

    constant wind velocity 5m/s
    constant air density 1.225kg/m3
    
    optimal lambda is ~7 for 3 blade , therefore 0.56m/s is optimal (lambda = R*omega/V_wind)
    
    x0 needs to be part of the feasible set. 0,0,0,0 is not part of this set, 
    
    therefore start at a point close to optimal (0.569105691, 7, 0, 0)
